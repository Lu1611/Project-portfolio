## Exercise 2: Greetings :ballot_box_with_check:

#Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just

#printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 

#personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["Chole", "Miro", "MJ", "Nina"]
for name in names:
    print(f"Hello {name}, I know Im gonna be out anyway")
